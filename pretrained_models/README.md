# pretrained_models/ ‚Äî Pretrained Teacher Model (Restormer)

This folder contains the reference and structure for the **Restormer Teacher Model** used in this project for knowledge distillation.

---

## Teacher Model Overview

- **Model**: Restormer (Restoration Transformer)
- **Purpose**: Acts as a strong teacher for guiding the lightweight student model (Mini-UNet)
- **Task**: Motion Deblurring on DIV2K patches (512√ó512)
- **Pretrained Weights**: Used official pretrained weights for motion deblurring

## Official Model Reference

- **Source Repo**: [Restormer - Official GitHub](https://github.com/swz30/Restormer)
- **Pretrained Model (Motion Deblurring)**:
  ```
  https://github.com/swz30/Restormer#pre-trained-models
  ```

## How It's Used

1. Inference is performed on the blurry patches using the pretrained `motion_deblurring.pth`.
2. The outputs are stored in:
   ```
   /outputs/teacher_output/train/train/
   /outputs/teacher_output/train/test/
   /outputs/teacher_output/benchmark/
   ```
3. These soft targets are used to train the student model using L1 + KD + VGG loss.

---

## Note

- No fine-tuning was performed on the teacher model.
- It serves purely as a **frozen teacher** for guiding the student model through knowledge distillation.
- Please cite or reference the original Restormer paper if using this work for academic research.
